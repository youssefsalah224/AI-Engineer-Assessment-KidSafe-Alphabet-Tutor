##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Node.js 16+ (for frontend development)
- API keys for required services (see [API Requirements](#-api-requirements))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youssefsalah224/AI-Engineer-Assessment-KidSafe-Alphabet-Tutor.git
   cd AI-Engineer-Assessment-KidSafe-Alphabet-Tutor
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API keys (see API Requirements section)
   ```

##  API Requirements

This project requires the following API services:

### Required APIs
- **OpenAI API** - For conversational AI and natural language processing
- **ElevenLabs API** - For high-quality text-to-speech synthesis
- **LiveKit** - For real-time voice and video streaming

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following variables:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
AZURE_DEPLOYMENT="",
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="",
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="",

# ElevenLabs Configuration  
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here

# LiveKit Configuration
LIVEKIT_URL=your_livekit_server_url
LIVEKIT_API_KEY=your_livekit_api_key
LIVEKIT_API_SECRET=your_livekit_api_secret
```

### API Key Setup Guide

1. **OpenAI API**: Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to generate your API key
2. **ElevenLabs API**: Sign up at [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) and obtain your API key
3. **LiveKit**: Create an account at [LiveKit Cloud](https://livekit.io/) for real-time communication services

##  Usage

### Web Application Mode

Start the full web application with voice interface:

```bash
uvicorn server:app --reload
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to access the interactive learning interface.

### Terminal Testing Mode

For development and testing purposes, especially when transcription API quotas are exceeded:

```bash
python agent.py
```

**Features of Terminal Mode:**
-  Standalone operation without web interface
-  Simulated speech input for testing learning logic
-  Complete alphabet tutoring functionality
-  No external API dependency for basic testing
-  Ideal for development and assessment review

This mode allows evaluators and developers to test the core educational logic even when API limits are reached.

##  Testing

The project includes comprehensive testing capabilities:

Run tests with:
```bash
python agent.py console/
```
some of agent feature will not be working in the server side as the transcription model ran out (qutao exceeded) so some parts will need far more testing 
## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Backend**: flask, Python 3.8+
- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML5, CSS3
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT models, custom phonics engine using live kit
- **Speech**: ElevenLabs TTS, LiveKit real-time audio
- **Deployment**: flask local server

##   Context

This project was developed as part of an AI Engineer role assessment, demonstrating:

- ‚úÖ **Conversational AI Development**
- ‚úÖ **Speech Processing Integration** 
- ‚úÖ **Child-Safe Content Design**
